Test Cases by Title

Overview
=========
The CAPx team put together a total of ten different test cases for the testing of CIS440.com. Please view each item below to gain an understanding of each test as well as how to use it. The tests created run on various platforms, ranging anywhere from C# to Python. 

**Test 1: SeleniumProjectFormTest_STEVETRUONG**
- *Please install FireFox to use this test*
- The aim of this test is to determine if the fields on the project form process invalid entries (i.e. not an email address for the email address field, etc.) It needs to be run using Visual Studios and you must have access to an Admin Account on CIS440.com. Download the file, unzip it, and open the solution in Visual Studios. Once open, look at the code and find two placeholders and replace them with the necessary information:
  - [ADMIN USER NAME]
  - [ADMIN PASSWORD]
- Once completed, run the solution. You should see a console window open followed by a FireFox browser window. Once the test is complete, the console window will appear and tell you which fields processed invalid input.

**Test 2: SeleniumAccessAdminWORights_STEVETRUONG**
