CAPx Repository
==============

Overview
=========

Develop a website specifically for the CIS 440 Capstone class. The site will allow both students and companies to post project opportunities. In addition, there will be an area that shows various past projects. Students will be able to view all available projects and rank them with a up/downvote system. Students will also be able to signup for projects directly on the site. Each project will have information provided by the company as well as Dr. Clark's comments. Additionally, each project will have Tags, giving a quick overview of the desired coding language, required technologies and other characteristics.
