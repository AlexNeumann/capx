					<p>Utilizing the knowledge from the Computer Information Systems (CIS) degree coursework, CIS 440: Systems Design and Electronic Commerce, gives CIS students the ability to put their technical knowledge to the test. Designed as the last required course for the degree, CIS seniors, in groups of 3-5, spend an entire semester working on a software development project that is assigned by an external client. Students will apply various iterative and incremental software development methodologies, such Scrum, to build a fully-shippable or potentially shippable product in the span of about 15 weeks. Since they will be practicing iterative development methodologies, students are required to have a total of six different product releases over the semester, in addition to a final, version 1.0, release, which they will showcase at the end of the semester. Clients will also provide the professor with feedback at the end of the semester on the student group that they worked with, which will factor into each team member's grade. If you'd like to propose a project for an upcoming semester, please visit the <strong>Propose Project</strong> page, to learn more about the requirements for a project. If you'd like some more information, or have questions for the professor, please visit the <strong>About & Contact</strong> page, to find the professor's contact information.</p>
