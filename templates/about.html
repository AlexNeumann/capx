					<p class="section-paragraph"> CIS 440, aka "Enterprise Systems Development", is the capstone course for the W. P. Carey Schoolâ€™s 
					undergraduate Information Systems program.  Over the course of fifteen weeks (or in the summer semester, six very compressed weeks), 
					our senior students work together in self-organizing teams to complete IT/IS projects that deliver tangible business value to real 
					businesses.  They apply the whole range of skills they have acquired through earlier Information Systems coursework, internships, 
					and work experience.
					</p>
					<p>
					Some of the important topics we 
					cover in the class, and that students can immediately put to practical use, include:
					</p>
					<ul>
					<li>the Agile approach to project management, and the Scrum framework in particular</li>
					<li>project scoping and requirements discovery</li>
					<li>metrics and "information radiators" for empirical project management</li>
					<li>modern software development practices including test-driven-development (TDD)</li>
					<li>Dev/Ops, continuous integration, automated testing, and continuous delivery</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					One of the main objectives of the course is that students will improve their communication and organizing skills as they learn 
					from (brutal) experience how to work as a self-organizing team and engage with a real client to complete a project with limited time 
					and resources.  They invariably experience miscommunications, unpredictably changing requirements, and a host of other challenges, 
					and learn to overcome them.
